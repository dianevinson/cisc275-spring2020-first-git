1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
First, it creates a new ArrayList called "dogs". Then, it creates 3 new dogs - Fido with 4 legs, Fido with 3 legs, and Alfie. Finally, it creates a new Comparator that compares objects of the Animal type. 

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
The class definition for the Comparator is done inline when the Comparator is being created. The only required method for a class extending the Comparator interface is compare(), which is defined when the object is made.
